<h1> Celeb Match </h2>
<p>Celeb match is a simple yet fun single-player game where the player uses their memory to match cards. The cards have celebrity photographs on them for a fun twist.
</p>

<h1>UX</h1>
<p>
I want the player to click on the cards and remember which ones match each other, when they are matched correctly the cards will not turn over again.
I want it to look and be simple yet fun.
</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<h2>Existing Features</h2>
<p>The game has two levels, the player must correctly match all the cards in level 1 and then continue to level 2 to finish the game.</p>

<h2>Features Left to Implement</h2>
In the future I would like to implement seperate pages for each level, as well as an overlay screen telling the user they have won, prompted by the user finishing the game.
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
This project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript.

<h1>Testing</h1>
